# MovieApp-Redux

A short demonstration on youtube: [Video](https://youtube.com/shorts/RM4pMV28XZA?feature=share)

I've built this movie library app using React Native and Redux. With this app, you can easily search for movies, view their details like descriptions and streaming options, and add them to your watchlist.

I created this app as a way to improve my understanding of React and Redux and to gain practical experience. It has been an enjoyable project that has allowed me to enhance my development skills.

To access information I use the OMDB API and the Streaming Availability API.
